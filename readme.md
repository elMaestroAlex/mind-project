# Mind Programming Language

### Write Tensorflow models in simple declarative way

#### Example simple linear regressions TensorFlow  graph
```

// Define a Simple tensorflow mode, 
// that represents linear regression
model Salary {
	
    // Define graph entities, scalars
    placeholder prestige float

    placeholder years int

    variable x float

    // Graph execution logic
    logic {
         return prestige + years * x
    }
}
```

## Motivation 

Tensorflow is great but complex framework. Mind project allow you following aspects
* Write TensorFlow models in declarative way
* Include submodels to models (deep learning) just in 1 string
* Build complex graphs in cascade style
* Export graphs from TF models trained by Python to Mind and vice versa.
* Reduce requrements of math for TF users
