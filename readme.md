# Mind Programming Language

### Write Tensorflow models in simple declarative way

#### Example simple linear regressions TensorFlow  graph
```
model Salary {
	
	placeholder prestige float

    placeholder years int

    variable x float

    output {
         prestige + years * x
    }

}
```

## Motivation 

Tensorflow is great but complex framework. Mind project allow you following aspects
* Write TensorFlow models in declarative way
* Include submodels to models (deep learning) just in 1 string
* Build complex graphs in cascade style
* Export graphs from TF models trained by Python to Mind and vice versa.
* Reduce requrements of math for TF users
